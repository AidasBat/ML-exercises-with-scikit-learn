# ML-with-scikit-learn
A collection of machine learning exercises completed during my ML course at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). This repository contains hands-on implementations of various machine learning concepts, covering regression, classification, clustering and more. Each exercise is structured as a Jupyter Notebook, complete with explanations, visualizations, and reproducible code.

## 📌 Topics Covered:  

✔️ Linear & Polynomial Regression, Regularization (Ridge, Lasso)  
✔️ Logistic Regression  
✔️ k-NN  
✔️ SVM  
✔️ Tree based methods - AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting...  
✔️ XGBoost  
✔️ Naive Bayes  
✔️ Dimensionality reduction - PCA, LDA  
✔️ Clustering - KMeans, Spectral Clustering, GMM
